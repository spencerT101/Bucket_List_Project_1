This is my first project in Python, it is built in Flask with a Postgres SQL database.

The brief was to build a bucketlist travel app that allows people to track their adventures.

The MVP was as follows:

-The app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.

-The user should be able to create and edit countries.

-Each country should have one or more cities to visit.

-The user should be able to create and delete entries for cities.

-The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see.
