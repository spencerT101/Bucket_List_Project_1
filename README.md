This is my first project in Python, it is built in Flask with a Postgres SQL database.
The brief was to build a bucketlist travel app that allows people to track their adventures.

The MVP was as follows:

-The app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.

-The user should be able to create and edit countries.

-Each country should have one or more cities to visit.

-The user should be able to create and delete entries for cities.

-The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see.

I decided to name my app NOMADIST, to keep it in tune with current fashions and trends in the travel and tourism industry, plus with remote working becoming an established way of living it seemed an apt choice.
